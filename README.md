# Predictive Modeling for Heart Disease Diagnosis: A Machine Learning Approach 

 
 

# AIM: 

Our project mainly focuses on cardiovascular health, utilizing modern machine-learning techniques to investigate and predict the presence of heart disease.  

Every year, about 1.5 million people die from cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is responsible for nearly 31% of all deaths worldwide. According to World Health Organization (WHO) data, low-income and middle-income countries account for 82 percent of global premature deaths, with cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounting for 37 percent due to late and unreliable prediction of heart disease. While these conditions are treatable, early detection and risk assessment of patients is critical to reducing the high mortality risks they pose.  

While there has been significant research on cardiac health markers, it is our view that there is a need for more research geared towards finding the correlation between individual risk factors.  

The intricate causes and diverse aspects of cardiovascular disease require advanced computer models to help doctors make better decisions. We are planning to build models to predict how the disease might progress, identify what might cause it, and suggest the best treatments for each person by using  a mix of medical records, images, body signals, genes, and lifestyle details to create strong and reliable predictions and  by adding personalized medicine ideas into these models, we can make treatments more specific and better suited to each person, improving how we manage heart-related conditions. 

 
Our project aims to investigate all these factors and form a working model.
